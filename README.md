The goal of this project was to create a functioning calculator in Javascript, HTML, and CSS all from scratch.

### UPDATE 11/12/15:
Project is finished for now. Will be revamped later after finishing  SimpleDesign

### Highlights:
- .getElementById 
- onload="" , onclick=""
- setting a function and calling it with myFunction()
- added a keypress event with .addEventListener and connected it to the "enter" key
- within a function use myFunction(this) to target "this" 
- Setting functions to alert uses to errors caused by consecutive key presses
- properly linking jQuery within the html documents and keeping an eye on the syntax as bugs come up
- using different methods to solve the same problem such as resetting an entire input box vs setting the value to "" onclick
- playing with color schemes and user experience with buttons and how the interact 
    (at one point the press of a button on the third column would push the buttons to its left down)

Cheers,

Adam
