# JavascriptCalc
Playing with Calculator in JS

The goal of this project is to get familiar with javascript.

So far I've experimented with:
- .getElementById
- onload="" , onclick=""
- setting a function and calling it with myFunction()
- added a keypress event with .addEventListener and connected it to the "enter" key
- within a function use myFunction(this) to target "this" 
- To be Continued...
