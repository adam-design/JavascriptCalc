# JavascriptCalc
Playing with Calculator in JS

The goal of this project is to create a functioning calculator in Javascript, HTML, and CSS all from scratch.

Specific focus of the project (working with javascript mostly)
- .getElementById
- onload="" , onclick=""
- setting a function and calling it with myFunction()
- added a keypress event with .addEventListener and connected it to the "enter" key
- within a function use myFunction(this) to target "this" 
- Setting functions to alert uses to errors caused by consecutive key presses

UPDATE: Project is finished for now. Will be revamped later after building a freelance website.

Cheers,

Adam
